<!-- The DirectoryFactory to use for indexes.
       
   solr.StandardDirectoryFactory is filesystem
   based and tries to pick the best implementation for the current
   JVM and platform.  solr.NRTCachingDirectoryFactory, the default,
   wraps solr.StandardDirectoryFactory and caches small files in memory
   for better NRT performance.

   One can force a particular implementation via solr.MMapDirectoryFactory,
   solr.NIOFSDirectoryFactory, or solr.SimpleFSDirectoryFactory.

   solr.RAMDirectoryFactory is memory based, not
   persistent, and doesn't work with replication.

<directoryFactory name="DirectoryFactory" 
                class="${solr.directoryFactory:solr.NRTCachingDirectoryFactory}"/>

<!-- The CodecFactory for defining the format of the inverted index.
   The default implementation is SchemaCodecFactory, which is the official Lucene
   index format, but hooks into the schema to provide per-field customization of
   the postings lists and per-document values in the fieldType element
   (postingsFormat/docValuesFormat). Note that most of the alternative implementations
   are experimental, so if you choose to customize the index format, it's a good
   idea to convert back to the official format e.g. via IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader)
   before upgrading to a newer version to avoid unnecessary reindexing.
