<!-- IndexReaderFactory

       Use the following format to specify a custom IndexReaderFactory,
       which allows for alternate IndexReader implementations.

       ** Experimental Feature **

       Please note - Using a custom IndexReaderFactory may prevent
       certain other features from working. The API to
       IndexReaderFactory may change without warning or may even be
       removed from future releases if the problems cannot be
       resolved.


       ** Features that may not work with custom IndexReaderFactory **

       The ReplicationHandler assumes a disk-resident index. Using a
       custom IndexReader implementation may cause incompatibility
       with ReplicationHandler and may cause replication to not work
       correctly. See SOLR-1366 for details.
