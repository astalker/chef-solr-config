<!-- Field Analysis Request Handler

       RequestHandler that provides much the same functionality as
       analysis.jsp. Provides the ability to specify multiple field
       types and field names in the same request and outputs
       index-time and query-time analysis for each of them.

       Request parameters are:
       analysis.fieldname - field name whose analyzers are to be used

       analysis.fieldtype - field type whose analyzers are to be used
       analysis.fieldvalue - text for index-time analysis
       q (or analysis.q) - text for query time analysis
       analysis.showmatch (true|false) - When set to true and when
           query analysis is performed, the produced tokens of the
           field value analysis will be marked as "matched" for every
           token that is produces by the query analysis
