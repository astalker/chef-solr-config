<!-- Request Handlers 

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrRequestHandler

       Incoming queries will be dispatched to a specific handler by name
       based on the path specified in the request.

       Legacy behavior: If the request path uses "/select" but no Request
       Handler has that name, and if handleSelect="true" has been specified in
       the requestDispatcher, then the Request Handler is dispatched based on
       the qt parameter.  Handlers without a leading '/' are accessed this way
       like so: http://host/app/[core/]select?qt=name  If no qt is
       given, then the requestHandler that declares default="true" will be
       used or the one named "standard".

       If a Request Handler is declared with startup="lazy", then it will
       not be initialized until the first request that uses it.

  <!-- SearchHandler

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SearchHandler

       For processing Search Queries, the primary Request Handler
       provided with Solr is "SearchHandler" It delegates to a sequent
       of SearchComponents (see below) and supports distributed
       queries across multiple shards
